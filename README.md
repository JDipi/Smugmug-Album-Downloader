Make sure to do the following after you install tampermonkey, or else your default download directory will be flooded with image files when you try to download an album:

  1) Go to your Tampermonkey dashboard
  2) Click settings
  3) Change the 1st option (Config Mode) to "Advanced"
  4) Scroll down to "Downloads BETA"
  5) Change "Download Mode" to "Browser API"
  6) Save and exit, accept the new "Manage Download" 
     permission if prompted.

### How to use

After installing the script, a button will appear near the gallery title

It will confirm if you want to download the photos

Then it will show progress and errors (if any)

*NOTE: I changed the UI a bit, so it looks less 90s now

NOTE: The script selects the highest quality version of the photos it can find, I may add a option to choose the quality in the future.

Things I might add in the future:
 - Download buttons for individual photos
 - The ability to choose the quality of photos
 - The ability to specify a range of photos to download
